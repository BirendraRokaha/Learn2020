## Hello,
This repo is a collection of things I am learning and improving on in 2020.
* Most of the learning is focused in Python for learning Algorithms and starting up on some projects.
* I am also learning C/C++ form scratch to get better understanding of lower level programming, Data structures and Pointers.
