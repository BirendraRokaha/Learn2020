The Basics

localhost:~$ ssh -v -p 22 -C neo@remoteserver

-v : Print debug information, particularly helpful when debugging an authentication problem. Can be used multiple times to print additional information.
-p 22 : Specify which port to connect to on the remote SSH server. 22 is not required as this is the default, but if any other port is listening connect to it using the -p parameter. The listening port is configured in the sshd_config file using the Port 2222 format.
-C : Compression is enabled on the connection using this parameter. If you are using the terminal over a slow link or viewing lots of text this can speed up the connection as it will compress the data transferred on the fly.
neo@ : The string before the @ symbol denotes the username to authenticate with against the remote server. Leaving out the user@ will default to using the username of the account you are currently logged in to (~$ whoami). User can also be specified with the -l parameter.
remoteserver : The hostname ssh is connecting to, this can be a fully qualified domain name, an IP address or any host in your local machines hosts file. To connect to a host that resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6 you can specify parameter -4 or -6 to the command line so it resolves correctly.
